> I've always had a passion for computers, from my Amstrad CPC 464 to my IBM PC 5150, and right up to the present day. I've spent most of my career in e-commerce, a field I'm particularly fond of for its simple yet complex issues. I did a quick stint in the world of **networking and Big Data**, but although I learned a lot there, it wasn't a business area that spoke to me. After a few years of **expertise in Java development**, I became interested in management. One step at a time, I went from Java developer to **<abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr>**, via **Lead Backend** and **Technical Manager**, in an e-Commerce company.

> After 4 years in e-Commerce, some major achievements and several major projects, I was considering a change of direction. I needed something more fulfilling than working for people whose aim is, and I quote, “to enrich themselves personally and society”. I had the opportunity to work in **e-Health** for an up-and-coming startup and I seized the chance to do something that made more sense to me. I'm now the **<abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr>** of a startup with 15 employees. I manage fewer people, earn less money, but the job is just as challenging and I now feel that my work has a “human” meaning.
